For example, LABELS: ['Transient', 'Gamma-ray Burst', 'young stellar object', 'microquasar'] GROUPS: {0}, OUTPUT: ['Stellar Evolution Stage', 'Quasar'] - because transient and burst are examples of event types, not object types.\nRULES you must follow:\n- One value from LABELS may belong to several values from GROUP. For example, [Black Hole Binary] -> [Black Hole, Binary System]\n- Output should only contain values from the GROUPS. Do not merge values from GROUPS into one value.\n- Place LABEL in a GROUP if you could make this decision only with this limited context. Do not refer to your knowledge. For example, do NOT place 'X-ray Transient' in 'Black Hole' because you know (additional context) that these events are often associated with accreting objects such as black holes or neutron stars. Or do NOT place GRB in Repeater GROUP unless SGR is mentioned.\n- If a value from LABELS is clearly an event type, not astronomical object type, then skip it. E.g transients and bursts (gamma-ray burst, fast radio burst) should be skipped.\nLABELS: {1}\nGROUPS: {0}\nOUTPUT:",
