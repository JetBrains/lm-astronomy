<p>As astronomy becomes increasingly reliant on multi-instrument and multi-messenger observations to detect transient phenomena, communication between astronomers has become increasingly important. In addition to messages used for automatic prompt follow-up observations, there are also GCN circulars and ATels (Astronomer&#39;s Telegram), which are short, human-written reports describing observations and their analysis. These reports often include an interpretation or discussion of the observations. Unlike the machine-readable GCN messages, which have a strictly defined format that assists with the association of the phenomena to particular objects or coordinates in the sky, these human-written reports do not have a defined format. However, they can be essential for the final interpretation of observations.</p>
<p><strong>We apply the GPT-3 model to the problem of extracting information from unstructured text in the form of GCN and ATel messages.</strong></p>
